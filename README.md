# Mention Task Router for Obsidian

A simple Obsidian plugin that automatically routes tasks containing @mentions to corresponding markdown files.

## Features

- Monitors your typing in Obsidian editor
- When you press Enter on a line containing @mentions (e.g., `@work`, `@personal`), the plugin:
  - Extracts all @mentions from the line
  - Removes the @mentions from the task text
  - Appends the task to corresponding files (e.g., `work.md`, `personal.md`)
  - Creates the file if it doesn't exist

## Usage

1. Type a task with one or more @mentions:
   ```
   Fix the login bug @work @urgent
   ```

2. Press Enter

3. The task `- [ ] Fix the login bug` will be appended to both `work.md` and `urgent.md`
